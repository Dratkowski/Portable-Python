Download the latest version of WinPython

  As of 3/2025, WinPython_3.12.9.0 has worked well for what you need. 
  
  Downloading "Winpython64-3.12.9.0slim.exe" and place it in a good spot on your computer. You can put it on a external 
  drive. 
  
  If you go the external drive, you will need a large storage drive (at least 68gb). This route is good if you plan on sharing    the tools. Remember, that external drive paths can change (typically D: or E:) and this may impact your .bat codes. You may     need to edit the .bat to relfect the proper drive distinction. 

  When you start installing your programs, store everything on the external drive for organization and to ensure that the     
  proper python applications are used.
